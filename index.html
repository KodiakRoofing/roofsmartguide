    <h2>Press Release: Kodiak Roofing Debunks the Myth of the 25-Year Workmanship Warranty</h2>
    <p><strong>June 25, 2025</strong></p>

    <p><strong>SACRAMENTO, CA —</strong> In an industry where longer warranties often masquerade as better protection, <strong>Kodiak Roofing</strong>, a trusted leader in roofing excellence, is setting the record straight: when it comes to workmanship warranties, <strong>10 years of real accountability</strong> is often more valuable than 25 years of marketing hype.</p>

    <p>“As more roofing companies advertise 25-year workmanship warranties, we’re seeing an alarming trend — customers are being misled,” said <strong>Chris Madden</strong>, VP of Operations at Kodiak Roofing. “These extended warranties sound impressive but are rarely backed by anything real or enforceable.”</p>

    <h3>Understanding the Difference</h3>
    <p>Unlike material warranties, which are typically provided by manufacturers, workmanship warranties are promises made by the installer. A 10-year workmanship warranty from a reputable company like Kodiak Roofing means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear coverage of installation-related defects</li>
      <li>Immediate support if something goes wrong</li>
      <li>A team that’s still around to honor the warranty</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By contrast, many 25-year workmanship warranties offered by non-certified contractors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Include fine print that voids the warranty under common conditions</li>
      <li>Are non-transferable or prorated into uselessness</li>
      <li>Are offered by businesses that statistically won’t exist in 10 years</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Expert Consensus</h3>
    <p>Most roofing industry experts agree: installation errors will show up within the first 2–5 years, if they happen at all. A 10-year workmanship warranty is more than sufficient to detect and fix any issues that result from the initial installation.</p>

    <p>“Offering a 25-year warranty doesn’t make a contractor better — it just makes their sales pitch longer,” said Madden. “Our commitment is to transparency, quality, and service. That’s why our 10-year workmanship warranty is honest, clear, and dependable.”</p>

    <h3>Kodiak’s Commitment</h3>
    <p>Kodiak Roofing has been serving Northern California with integrity and craftsmanship for over 20 years. Every project comes with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Premium roofing systems</li>
      <li>Certified installers</li>
      <li>Transparent warranty documentation</li>
      <li>10 years of real coverage — not fine print fiction</li>
    </ul>
